        <li><b> King, Stephen. On Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition.</b> <a href="https://stephenking.com/p/20-years-on-writing/">URL</a> <a href="https://www.kfpl.ca/c/catalogue/record/1.52282">KFPL</a>
        <p>Equal parts biography and advice, with plenty of practical examples. Find out what Stephen King believes should be in every writer's toolbox. </p></li>
        <li> <b>Bird, Matt. The Secrets of Story: Innovative Tools for Perfecting Your Fiction and Captivating Readers</b> <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/633749/the-secrets-of-story-by-matt-bird/">URL</a>
        <p>The pitch for this book is a parable: "You’ve just boarded a plane. You’ve loaded your phone with your favorite podcasts, but before you can pop in your earbuds, disaster strikes: The guy in the next seat starts telling you all about something crazy that happened to him–in great detail. This is the unwelcome storyteller, trying to convince a reluctant audience to care about his story. We all hate that guy, right? But when you tell a story (any kind of story: a novel, a memoir, a screenplay, a stage play, a comic, or even a cover letter), you become the unwelcome storyteller. So how can you write a story that audiences will embrace? The answer is simple: Remember what it feels like to be that jaded audience. Tell the story that would win you over, even if you didn’t want to hear it."</p>
